I'm mainly uploading this since I put it onto VirusTotal out of curiosity, where for some reason it's currently being called ransomware although never asking for any ransom? along with pinging IP addresses? I mean it's an unobfuscated C# binary, they can just view the source code with [ILSpy](https://github.com/icsharpcode/ILSpy/releases) or similar tools.

In hindsight, I shouldn't have uploaded it to VirusTotal. I should've just kept it as a personal project to learn C#, I should've added a Y/N prompt.
